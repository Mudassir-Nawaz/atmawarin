## About the Project

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. It allows you to manage content with Markdown files and provides powerful templating for developers.

## Managing Content

### Adding Pages
1. Navigate to the `content` directory of your Hugo project.
2. Choose the appropriate folder for your content type (e.g., `content/articles`, `content/reading`, etc.).
3. Create a new Markdown file with the desired name, e.g., `new-page.md`.
4. Add the front matter at the top of the file:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "New Page"
    date: 2025-01-09
    ---
    ```
5. Add your page content below the front matter.

### Editing Pages
1. Locate the Markdown file for the page you want to edit in the `content` directory.
2. Open the file in a text editor.
3. Make changes to the content or front matter as needed.
4. Save the file and run `hugo server` to preview changes locally.

## Managing Menus

1. Open the `config.yaml` file in the root of your project.
2. Locate the `menus` section:
    ```yaml
    menus:
      main: 
        - name: "About"
          weight: 10
          url: "/about"
    ```
3. To add a menu item, add a new entry in the `menus` section with the `name`, `url`, and `weight`(for footer menus navigate to `footer` section of the `menu`).
4. Save the changes, and the new menu item will appear in the navigation.
