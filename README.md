## About the Project

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. It allows you to manage content with Markdown files and provides powerful templating for developers.

## Managing Content

### Adding Pages
1. Navigate to the `content` directory of your Hugo project.
2. Choose the appropriate folder for your content type (e.g., `content/blog`, `content/pages`, etc.).
3. Create a new Markdown file with the desired name, e.g., `new-page.md`.
4. Add the front matter at the top of the file:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "New Page"
    date: 2025-01-09
    draft: false
    ---
    ```
5. Add your page content below the front matter.

### Editing Pages
1. Locate the Markdown file for the page you want to edit in the `content` directory.
2. Open the file in a text editor.
3. Make changes to the content or front matter as needed.
4. Save the file and run `hugo server` to preview changes locally.

## Managing Menus

1. Open the `config.toml` or `config.yaml` file in the root of your project.
2. Locate the `menu` section:
    ```toml
    [[menu.main]]
    name = "Home"
    url = "/"
    weight = 1
    ```
3. To add a menu item, add a new entry in the `menu.main` section with the `name`, `url`, and `weight`.
4. Save the changes, and the new menu item will appear in the navigation.

## For Developers

### Prerequisites
- Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if the project uses tools like Tailwind CSS or PostCSS.

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if applicable):  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the local development server:  
   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:1313` in your browser to preview the website.

### Deployment
- Follow the instructions for your hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) to deploy the website.  
- Ensure the `public` folder is built using `hugo` before deploying.
