I used to think that philosophy and existensialism discourse is boring stuff. But Waking Alive open up the whole spectrum of world for me. With a long rambling conversation that become the hallmark of Linklater, this movie use a technique called Rotoscoping to trace the original camera recording. It's really align well with the movie theme about dreaming.
