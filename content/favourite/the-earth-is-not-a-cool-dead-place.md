A great intro for a post rock band. Released in 2003, this is album of 4 person with 2 guitar, a bass and a drum. The first song "First Breath After Comma" is so aptly named, with a slow steadh beat of drum and guitar. Their second song "The Only Moment We Were Alone" will foreverly attached into my head along with the hours and hours of time that I spent on it. I hope when I die or goes into coma someone would do me a favor to play the whole album for me.
