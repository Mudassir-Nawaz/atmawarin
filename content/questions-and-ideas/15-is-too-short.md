If you have a meeting or a rite that you did regularly, one of the best thing that you can do to make it more fun and have a little bit zest in it is to set it up so that it would start at a really odd hour (say 8.33 in the morning) and end in strange time as well (end 23 minutes later). It help to curve the thing away and make it ring better ("8.23 meeting" sounds way better than "daily scrum").
