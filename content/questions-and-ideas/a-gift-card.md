In the future, as we transition away from physical money to digital one. It would be really cool if I can digitally pull the money that I have in bank (say Rp100,000), make a digital gift card from it (with expiration date), imbue the card with the things that kids might like (says collectible pokemon series as in nft form), print it, and then gift it to my niece.
