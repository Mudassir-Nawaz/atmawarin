Seeing and develop a companies that grow from 13 person to 200 person. I understand how hard it is to be caught in the loop of real work that later turn into busy work â€“ that doesn't add real value. Sometimes there are some report that come into my inbox, and just passing through. No action, no todo, just passing by. I still need it that report as I understand the context of **why that particular report created**, but my guess is that there are 25-45% report or work out there that actually can be eliminated without us losing value.
