title: ðŸ”¥ A checklist of "You'll be disappointed because you didn't do this before and during the project".
type: "idea"

Taking the experience that I have as both client and vendor, there are some stuff that I wish I did before and during the project. It's' going to be great if there are some checklist generator that would guide me and have two section checklist. The first is more general stuff such as communication and process, and the second section is more into specific checklist (house build project and website build project would have different checklist). Each list within the checklist would have an example/anectode/story about disappointment that happened because someone didn't do it.
