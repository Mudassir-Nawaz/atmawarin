All of the legal document that I see in notary or court record in Indonesia is typed and printed using a monospace font. They try to mimic what we used to have in the old days when we still use analog typewriter. This tradition is being kept even when the technology and typeface setting now in digital world already allow us to produce a much better legible document. From functional point of view, this doesn't make any sense for me.
