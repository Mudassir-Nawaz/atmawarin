Most of the information that you consume, read, work, write, store, save, **has a default as private**. What you do later then to process that information and cherry pick which one do you want to share into a certain people or group. What if instead of default private, **the way all that information processing would be** DEFAULT SHARE. Photo that you take today would automatically shared within one week (unless you later specifically filter it out). So Instead of curating things that you would publish, you curate things that you want to keep private. This is a radical expriment of course, and one that not for the meek, but the current technology and automation already allowed us to do this, and I curious on how it would look like to run this kind of experiment with someone.
