It's bloody difficult to find any decent cafe that open before 8 AM in Yogyakarta. What is going on here? Is this means that **coffee as fuel** for the working class is **not the main driver** of cafe explosions in Yogyakarta? Is it byproduct of **social media culture** where cafe focus is in it's outlook rather than it's product? This is something that puzzle and frustate me to no end. I want a good double shoot flat white in the morning. How difficult is that?
