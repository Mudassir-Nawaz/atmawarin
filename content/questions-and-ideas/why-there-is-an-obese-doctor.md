Something that I can't understand yet is why there is an obese doctor out there? It's akin to see a car mechanic who don't take care his own car. Doctor spend years in medical school, and decades teaching healthy life style â€“ knowledge & motivation is not an issue. And since become doctor is a helluva difficult things to do, I doubt that this is a "will power" issue as well.
