A courage to do things that you think right and not worrying about what people or society says is a very nice mental model to have. Unfortunately, this is not a model that school will teach to my kids â€“ which is natural as the goal of school is to keep things in order and teach people to work together. **But since this type of fearlessness (or awareness) will allow you to life like a true royalty, like a king, or queen**, I really want to teach it to my kids. It's a marvelous feeling to have! Is there any kind of routine or things that I can do to help them to do this?
