The next time you kicking yourself for your flaw or mistake, try to picture you 10 years ago and see what you think of him/her now. I bet you will have a higher opinion of him/her, compared to your opinion of your **now** self. This is a good reminder that you need to try to keep play the long game, not only in business, but also in accepting yourself.
