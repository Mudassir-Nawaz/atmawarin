One thing that you can do to be kind to yourself and be more relaxed about your todo list queue is to imagine that you are a great librarian. You greet each of your customer, ensure that his/her needs fulfilled well. But when it's 5PM, you respectfully greet everyone. Apologize for those that not yet you able to serve. But back home anyway without guilt, as you know that you can still help them the next day.
