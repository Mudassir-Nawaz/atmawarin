It's really baffled me the hate that insects get from human. Most of us despise insect and even use it as a deragotary term. Insect!! Why do we have this common hatred to this small animal? Is this come from movie and media? Or we have a primal knowledge there that we inherit from our ancestor where most of them has a bad experience with insect?
