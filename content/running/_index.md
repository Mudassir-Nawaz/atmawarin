I enjoy running as solitude endeavor. Not for the performance, nor for health benefit, nor for productivity. Running is just run. A leisure. It provides me a way to understand a little bit more about myself and the world. It's adventurous. It's easy. It's hard. Its one thing that I always looking forward when I close my eyes at night.
